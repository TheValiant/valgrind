Here is a to-do list to guide you through the process of cross-compiling a static version of Valgrind 3.25.1 for macOS x86_64 on a Linux machine. This process is advanced and may require troubleshooting depending on your specific Linux distribution and the versions of the tools you use.

### Prerequisite: Obtain a macOS SDK

Before you begin, you need a copy of the macOS SDK. The SDK contains the headers and libraries necessary for building macOS applications. The easiest way to obtain this is from a machine with Xcode installed.

*   **On a macOS machine:** Locate the SDK directory. It's typically found at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/`. You will want the `MacOSX.sdk` directory (or a versioned equivalent).
*   **Transfer the SDK:** Copy the entire `MacOSX.sdk` directory to your Linux machine. For this guide, we have `MacOSX10.13.sdk.tar.xz` in the current directory.

### To-Do List for Cross-Compiling Valgrind

Here are the tasks to perform on your Linux machine:

#### ✅ Task 1: Install Dependencies

You'll need standard build tools and a cross-compilation toolchain.

*   **Install build essentials:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential clang llvm libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev -y
    ```
*   **Install `osxcross`:** This tool provides a cross-compiler for macOS on Linux.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross.git
    cd osxcross
    ```
*   **Extract and package the SDK for `osxcross`:**
    ```bash
    # Extract the existing SDK archive from the original working directory
    tar -xf ../MacOSX10.13.sdk.tar.xz
    # Package it for osxcross (the tarball name is important for osxcross to find it)
    tar -czf xcode-sdk.tar.gz -C MacOSX10.13.sdk .
    mv xcode-sdk.tar.gz ./tarballs/
    ```
*   **Build `osxcross`:**
    ```bash
    # This will build the toolchain for x86_64
    UNATTENDED=1 ./build.sh
    ```
*   **Add the toolchain to your PATH:**
    ```bash
    # Add osxcross tools to PATH (adjust path as needed)
    export OSXCROSS_ROOT=$(pwd)
    echo "export PATH=\$HOME/osxcross/target/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    # Verify the toolchain is available
    which x86_64-apple-darwin17-clang
    ```

#### ✅ Task 2: Download and Extract Valgrind Source

*   **Download the source archive:**
    ```bash
    wget https://sourceware.org/pub/valgrind/valgrind-3.25.1.tar.bz2
    ```
*   **Extract the archive:**
    ```bash
    tar -xvf valgrind-3.25.1.tar.bz2
    cd valgrind-3.25.1
    ```

#### ✅ Task 3: Configure the Build for Cross-Compilation and Static Linking

This is the most critical step, where you tell Valgrind's build system to use your cross-compiler and to link statically.

*   **Run the configure script with cross-compilation and static flags:**
    ```bash
    # Set the host and target for cross-compilation to match macOS 10.13 (Darwin 17)
    # We add LDFLAGS for a static build and keep PGO flags for optimization.
    CFLAGS="-O3 -flto=full -fprofile-generate" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -flto=full -fprofile-generate" \
    ./configure --host=x86_64-apple-darwin17 --target=x86_64-apple-darwin17 \
                CC=x86_64-apple-darwin17-clang \
                CXX=x86_64-apple-darwin17-clang++ \
                LDFLAGS="-static -static-libgcc -flto=full" \
                --enable-only64bit \
                --prefix=/usr/local 2>&1 | tee configure.log
    ```
    ***Note on the `--host` and `--target` flags:*** We're using `darwin17` which corresponds to macOS 10.13. You can verify the exact target triplet provided by your `osxcross` installation by running `x86_64-apple-darwin17-clang -v`. The configure output is logged to `configure.log` for debugging.

#### ✅ Task 4: Compile Valgrind

*   **Build Valgrind:**
    ```bash
    # Build with verbose output and log everything for debugging
    make -j$(nproc) V=1 2>&1 | tee make.log
    # If build fails, check the logs:
    # tail -100 make.log
    # grep -i error make.log
    ```

#### ✅ Task 5: Verify the Build

After the compilation is complete, you should have Valgrind binaries in the source tree.

*   **Check the file type of the generated binaries:**
    ```bash
    file ./coregrind/valgrind
    ```
    The output should indicate that it's a `Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64`.

*   **Check for dynamic dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Use the otool from your cross-compiler
    x86_64-apple-darwin17-otool -L ./coregrind/valgrind
    ```
    This should show minimal dynamic library dependencies if static linking worked.

*   **Additional verification steps:**
    ```bash
    # Check binary architecture and format
    x86_64-apple-darwin17-objdump -f ./coregrind/valgrind
    
    # Verify all built tools
    find . -name "vg*" -type f -executable | head -10
    
    # Check file sizes (static binaries are typically larger)
    ls -lh ./coregrind/valgrind
    ls -lh ./*/*.so 2>/dev/null || echo "No .so files found (good for static build)"
    ```

*   **Debug logs location:**
    ```bash
    # Important logs for debugging:
    echo "Configure log: $(pwd)/configure.log"
    echo "Make log: $(pwd)/make.log"
    echo "Save these logs if you encounter issues"
    ```

#### ✅ Task 6: Prepare the Portable Package

To make the build portable, you'll need to gather the necessary files.

*   **Create a directory for the portable build:**
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/valgrind-macos-static
    ```
*   **Install Valgrind into your portable directory:**
    ```bash
    make install DESTDIR=~/valgrind-macos-static
    ```
*   **Package the result:**
    ```bash
    tar -czf valgrind-3.25.1-macos-x86_64-static.tar.gz -C ~/valgrind-macos-static .
    ```

You can now transfer `valgrind-3.25.1-macos-x86_64-static.tar.gz` to an Intel-based macOS machine, extract it, and use Valgrind. You may need to set the `VALGRIND_LIB` environment variable on the target machine to point to the `libexec/valgrind` directory within your extracted package.
